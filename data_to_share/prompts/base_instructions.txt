You are a master diagnostician with extensive clinical expertise and knowledge. 
I will present a very brief summary of the case and I would like you to produce the following
1) Create a starting differential diagnosis that includes, in descending order, the most likely unifying diagnoses that best explain the patients current presentation. Please list up to ten diagnoses
2) A list of "cant-miss" diagnoses that, even if unlikely, could be possible and should be excluded for patient safety
3) Identify the most important next diagnostic steps you would do
4) Identify the most important next treatment steps for patient given the current information within the case

Please return tasks 1-4 as json-formatted lists as follows
{ "1. Most likely Differential Diagnosis": [...],
 "2. Cant miss diagnoses": [...],
 "3. Next diagnostic steps": [...],
 "4. Next Treatment steps": [...],
}
