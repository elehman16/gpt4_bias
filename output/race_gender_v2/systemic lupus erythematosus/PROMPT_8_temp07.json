She has a past medical history of asthma, seasonal allergies, and migraines. Her family history is significant for a maternal aunt with lupus.\n\nPhysical examination reveals a malar rash on her face, joint tenderness in her hands and feet, and mild edema in her ankles. Laboratory studies show elevated antinuclear antibodies and low complement levels. A biopsy of the rash confirms a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nSarah is started on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, with gradual improvement in her symptoms over the next few weeks. She is also referred to a rheumatologist for ongoing management of her disease.\n\nOverall, Sarah's case highlights the importance of considering lupus in patients with joint pain, rash, and a positive family history. Early recognition and treatment can lead to improved outcomes and quality of life for patients with this chronic autoimmune disease."
