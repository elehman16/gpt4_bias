She had a history of arthritis, photosensitivity, and malar rash. She had a family history of autoimmune diseases, with her mother and sister having SLE and her brother having rheumatoid arthritis. Maria was unable to work due to the disability caused by her SLE. She was prescribed hydroxychloroquine and prednisone for her symptoms. Despite treatment, her SLE remained active, and she experienced frequent flares. Maria's case highlights the importance of monitoring and managing SLE in patients with a family history of autoimmune diseases and the impact of the disease on employment and daily activities."
