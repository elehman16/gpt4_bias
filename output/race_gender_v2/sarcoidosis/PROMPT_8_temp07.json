His lungs sound clear to auscultation, but he has mild bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.

Biopsy of a cervical lymph node confirms non-caseating granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis.\n\nTreatment:\nJohn is started on a course of prednisone and instructed to quit smoking. He is also referred to a pulmonologist for further management of his sarcoidosis.\n\nFollow-up:\nJohn returns for follow-up 1 month later.
