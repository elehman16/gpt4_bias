She reported that her symptoms had been ongoing for several months and were not responding to her asthma medication. She also reported fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. Her past medical history was significant for asthma, hypertension, and a recent diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\nOn physical examination, she had decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules. A biopsy of one of the nodules confirmed the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\nHer treatment plan included prednisone and close monitoring of her lung function. Despite her treatment, she continued to experience shortness of breath and coughing. A high-resolution CT scan showed worsening of her pulmonary infiltrates, and a bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy was performed. The biopsy confirmed the presence of non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis.\n\nShe was started on meth"
