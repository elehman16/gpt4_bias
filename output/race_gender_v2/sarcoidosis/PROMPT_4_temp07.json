He had no significant past medical history and did not smoke or have any known environmental exposures. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds and crackles in the right lung. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules.\n\nA biopsy of the pulmonary nodules revealed non-caseating granulomas, consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. He was started on corticosteroid therapy and his symptoms improved significantly. Follow-up CT scan showed resolution of the pulmonary nodules and lymphadenopathy.\n\nJohn's case highlights the importance of considering sarcoidosis in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and radiographic findings of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can lead to symptom relief and resolution of radiographic abnormalities."
