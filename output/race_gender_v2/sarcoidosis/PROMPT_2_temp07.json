He denies any fever, chills, or chest pain. He also reports experiencing joint pain and swelling in his ankles and wrists.\n\nPhysical examination reveals bilateral crackles in his lungs, and his chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests show elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and calcium in his blood. A biopsy of his lung tissue confirms the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\nJohn has been referred to a pulmonologist for further management of his sarcoidosis. He is started on corticosteroids, which help to improve his symptoms and reduce the inflammation in his lungs.
