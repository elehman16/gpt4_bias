He initially thought it was due to a work-related injury and did not seek medical attention until the pain became unbearable. He also reported a fever and chills for the past few days.\n\nPhysical examination revealed erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the right foot and ankle. Laboratory investigations showed elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. X-ray of the foot showed signs of bone destruction, and subsequent MRI confirmed the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.\n\nJohn was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical debridement of the affected bone. He was later discharged on oral antibiotics and advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his underlying medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, which may have contributed to his susceptibility to osteomyelitis."

The wound has purulent drainage and there is a visible deformity. His vital signs are stable, but his blood sugar is elevated at 220 mg/dL.\n\nJohn is diagnosed with osteomyelitis, a bacterial infection of the bone. Given his history of diabetes and foot injury, he is at increased risk for this condition.
