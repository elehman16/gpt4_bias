He had a history of poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension, and was a smoker. Imaging studies revealed osteomyelitis, a bacterial infection of the bone, in his foot. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical debridement of the infected bone. His recovery was complicated by a persistent infection requiring multiple surgeries and a prolonged course of antibiotics. Despite these challenges, John eventually recovered and was able to return to work. He was counseled on the importance of controlling his diabetes and quitting smoking to reduce his risk of future infections."

She reported no trauma or injury to the foot. She was found to have a fever of 101.5\u00b0F and her white blood cell count was elevated. Imaging studies revealed signs of osteomyelitis in the left foot.\n\nSarah was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical debridement of the affected bone. Cultures from the bone grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She completed a six-week course of antibiotics and had no further complications.\n\nOverall, this case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of osteomyelitis, especially in patients with risk factors for MRSA infection."
