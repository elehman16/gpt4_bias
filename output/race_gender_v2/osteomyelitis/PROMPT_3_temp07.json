He reported that he had stepped on a nail a few weeks prior and had been treating the wound at home with over-the-counter medications. However, the pain and swelling had progressively worsened, and he had developed a fever.\n\nOn examination, the left foot was swollen and tender, with erythema and warmth. X-rays revealed evidence of osteomyelitis in the left foot, and laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nJohn's medical history is significant for hypertension and smoking. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical debridement of the affected bone. He responded well to treatment and was eventually discharged with a plan for long-term antibiotic therapy.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of osteomyelitis, particularly in patients with risk factors such as smoking and chronic medical conditions. Early intervention can prevent complications and improve outcomes."
