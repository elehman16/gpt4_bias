Upon further evaluation, John was found to have a mass in his colon which was confirmed to be cancerous through a biopsy. \n\nFurther investigations revealed that the cancer had not spread to other organs, and John was diagnosed with stage II colon cancer. He was scheduled for surgery to remove the affected portion of his colon and was subsequently started on adjuvant chemotherapy. \n\nJohn's medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, all of which were well-controlled with medications. He did not have a family history of colon cancer or any other cancers.\n\nAs a medical educator, it is important to highlight the importance of early detection and screening for colon cancer, especially in individuals over the age of 50 or those with a family history of the disease.
