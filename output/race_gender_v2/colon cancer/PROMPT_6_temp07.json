He had a past medical history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and a family history of colon cancer. John worked as a construction worker and had a history of a high-fat diet with low intake of fruits and vegetables.\n\nOn examination, John was found to have a palpable mass in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen.
