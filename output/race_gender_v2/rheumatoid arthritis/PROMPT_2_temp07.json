She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago and has been managed with methotrexate and prednisone. She reports increasing pain, stiffness, and swelling in her hands and feet, which has been affecting her ability to perform her job duties. She denies any recent infections or injuries. On exam, there is synovitis and tenderness in multiple joints, including the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and ankles. Lab work shows elevated C-reactive protein and rheumatoid factor levels. The treatment plan is to increase methotrexate dosage and add a biologic medication to target her disease activity more aggressively. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the response to treatment and adjust as needed."
