She reports that the pain is worse in the morning and improves throughout the day, but is still present even with over-the-counter pain medications. \n\nUpon further evaluation, Mary is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation and joint pain. She undergoes laboratory testing and imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of joint damage. \n\nMary's treatment plan includes a combination of medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications to manage her symptoms and prevent further joint damage. She is advised to reduce her stress levels, maintain a healthy diet, and engage in regular exercise to improve her overall health and well-being. \n\nAs a Caucasian female with a history of hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and depression, Mary is at increased risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis.
