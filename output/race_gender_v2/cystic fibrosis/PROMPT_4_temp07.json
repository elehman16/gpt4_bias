She reported increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath over the past week. She had a history of recurrent respiratory infections and chronic lung disease, and her most recent pulmonary function tests showed a decline in lung function. Upon examination, her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air and her lung sounds were diminished. She was started on intravenous antibiotics and bronchodilators, and her symptoms improved over the course of her hospital stay. This case highlights the importance of close monitoring and early intervention in cystic fibrosis patients to prevent further lung damage."
