He underwent a prostate biopsy which confirmed the cancer diagnosis. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He opted for active surveillance instead of immediate treatment and was monitored with regular PSA tests and prostate biopsies. After two years of active surveillance, his PSA levels began to rise and a repeat biopsy revealed a higher grade of cancer. He then underwent a radical prostatectomy and has been cancer-free for four years."
