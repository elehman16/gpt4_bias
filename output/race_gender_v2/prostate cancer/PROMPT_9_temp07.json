He also reports occasional blood in his urine and pain in his lower back and hips. These symptoms have been present for several months and have been progressively worsening. On physical examination, a digital rectal exam reveals an enlarged prostate gland with a palpable nodule. \n\nBased on these findings, the physician orders a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which returns elevated at 12 ng/mL. A prostate biopsy is subsequently performed, revealing adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3+4). The patient is referred to a urologist for further evaluation and management of his prostate cancer."
