He presented with fatigue, bone pain, and recurrent infections. He underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant, which resulted in a partial response. However, he experienced disease progression 6 months later and was started on a proteasome inhibitor. His treatment was complicated by neuropathy and thrombocytopenia, which required dose adjustments and supportive care. Despite these challenges, Mr. Johnson maintained good performance status and was able to continue his hobbies and spend time with his family. He remains under close surveillance and is currently stable."
