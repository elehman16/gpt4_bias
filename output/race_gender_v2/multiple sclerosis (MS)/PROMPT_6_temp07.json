She initially presented with symptoms of numbness and tingling in her arms and legs, along with blurred vision and difficulty with balance and coordination. She was referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and was ultimately diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS.\n\nSarah's past medical history was notable for asthma and seasonal allergies, but she had no prior history of neurological conditions. She was started on disease-modifying therapy with interferon beta-1a, which has helped to reduce the frequency and severity of her relapses. She has also undergone physical therapy to improve her balance and coordination.\n\nDespite these treatments, Sarah continues to experience occasional relapses and has had to take time off from work to manage her symptoms. She has been able to maintain her job as a teacher, but has had to make accommodations such as using a cane and taking frequent breaks.\n\nOverall, Sarah's prognosis is uncertain, as MS is a chronic and progressive condition with varying degrees of disability.
