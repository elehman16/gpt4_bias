She had been on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for the past 6 years and had been relatively stable with no new lesions on MRI. However, she presented to her neurologist with new symptoms of numbness and tingling in her legs, difficulty walking, and blurry vision. Her neurological exam revealed decreased sensation in both legs and decreased visual acuity in her left eye. An MRI confirmed new lesions in her spinal cord and brain. She was started on a higher dose of DMT and referred for physical therapy. After several months of treatment, her symptoms improved and she was able to return to work."
