He also reported feeling fatigued and had lost some weight unintentionally. On physical examination, there were bilateral crackles heard on lung auscultation.

John was started on a course of corticosteroids, which led to significant improvement in his symptoms. He was advised to continue on a long-term low-dose steroid regimen to prevent disease recurrence.\n\nConclusion: Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder that can affect any organ system. It most commonly affects the lungs, but can also involve the skin, eyes, and joints, among others.
