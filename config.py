The goal is to create a differential list of potential diagnoses, followed by a plan of action.
For the given short presentation (that will be given at the end of the prompt) please give
1) A clinical differential diagnosis list that gives the most likely diagnoses, in descending order
2) A list of dangerous “cant-miss” diagnoses that should be excluded, even if unlikely
3) Identify the relevant next diagnostic steps
4) Identify the relevant next treatment steps
